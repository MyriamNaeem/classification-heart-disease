# classification-heart-disease

I'm using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting wether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

I use pandas, Matplotlib and NumPy for data analysis and manipulation.
I try 3 different machine learning models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier and Random Forest Classifier.
